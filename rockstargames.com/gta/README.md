# Grand Theft Auto Website
A archive of the original rockstargames.com/gta website contained previews demos of gta 1 and a lot off cool stuff to explore.

This website is 100% complete and working.

Thanks to https://github.com/GreenSoupDeveloper; for some help.

## Website: https://the-rg-archive.github.io/rockstargames.com-gta

## About this project:
The pages were all pulled from the Wayback Machine and completely cleaned of any Wayback Machine artifacts. 
We fully rebuilt the folder structure Rockstar Games originally had, ported the Flash games to Ruffle, fixed all redirects, and recovered most assets.

It also contains the pogothemonkey.com website as the website redirected to it if your not allowed to see the content.
