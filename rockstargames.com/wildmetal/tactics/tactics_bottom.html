If your vehicle turns over, try using your turret to lever
yourself back up. Shooting at the ground will also do the trick but is
likely to cause damage. 

<p>
Use beacons to mark areas of interest and to orientate yourself to help
avoid getting lost.

<p>
If power cores are in awkward or inaccessible places, shoot them somewhere
else.

<p>
Choose your ground carefully - if your tank is on uneven ground or tilting
upwards it might be difficult to hit targets, especially at close range.

<p>
Ramming can be very effective especially in multiplayer games (try using the
boost at the same time for extra damage).

<p>
Remember to use the helicopters if your tank gets stuck.

<p>
To become expert at the game you need to be able to turn your turret while
driving. 

<p>
Different weapons are effective at different ranges and under different
situations. Experiment with all the weapons - all of them can be very
useful.

<p>
Hover Vehicles - If the opportunity arises to take control of a hover
vehicle, the controls are slightly different. Instead of Boost and Brake the
hover vehicles use Hover and Land controls (using the Boost and Brake
buttons).
