For centuries, no one had visited the three planets of the Tehric system.  Tundra, the Aztec Planet and the Red planet had been abandoned when technology advanced to a stage where highly dangerous automated military units developed self-awareness   a devastating effect for all living things in the Tehric system.  Originally intended to protect vital power cores from invaders, the machines rebelled, deciding to wipe out all biological life.  With no other options, humanity withdrew, leaving the system to the mercy of this new breed of killers.  Having since evolved to replace biological life, there is little evidence of the human race   only the ruins of their cities remain.

<p>
In the years that followed mechanical unrest, human technology recovered.  Soon thereafter, plans to retake the planets were hatched.  In your role as an intergalactic bounty hunter, you have been employed to attempt to locate and capture the elusive power cores and disrupt the machines for all time.  Armed with your wits and an array of futuristic weaponry, you ve embarked on a mission you cannot afford to fail.

<p>
Hunt or be hunted. Kill or Be Killed.  Reclaim the Future for Mankind.
