<p><b>Install instructions:</b></p>

Please note that this skin will only work with Winamp 3.  If you do not have Winamp 3, you may download it <a href="http://www.winamp.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>
1. Click the link to the file.  Depending on your configuration, your computer may self-install the skin automatically and then run Winamp 3.  If this happens, skip the next steps - you're done.  If a dialogue box pops up instead, continue following these instructions.  
<br><br>
2. Select the option to save the file, and save it to your Winamp 3 skins directory (by default, C:\Program Files\Winamp3\Skins).
<br><br>
3. Run Winamp 3 from your Start menu, and open the preferences window by pressing ctrl-P.
<br><br>
4. Select the Skins option, then select the Vice City skin and click "switch".
<br><br>
Tip: If you have not already done so, enabling desktop alpha under the Advanced system settings (also in the preferences window) vastly improves the look of this skin as well as many others.  However, we recommend this only for PC's with at least a 1.2Ghz CPU.
