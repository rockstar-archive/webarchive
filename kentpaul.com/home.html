	<br>
	<font class="orange18">October 1, 2002</font><br>
	<br>
	<font class="blue12"><b>Hello, everybody. How are we all? Having a wonderful time of it?</b></font><br>
	Enjoying an amusing sojourn on the world-wide information super-highway web? I do hope so. You've stumbled across
	Kent Paul's 80's Nostalgia Zone, possibly the best site on the internet.<br>
	<br>
	Just to clarify, like the banner says, <b>the name is Paul, but I'm from Kent.</b> Rather than being called Kent,
	like some idiot septic with a brother named Troy or whatever. Currently, I am spending time at an after care
	programme, having recently left primary, but I will VERY soon be back on my feet and out in the big bad world
	causing some serious trouble once more. I know I appear to be unfeasibly cheerful this month - this is because my
	doctor, a certain Dr. Perkins, has said <font class="pink12"><b>if I can manage to be cheerful and not create what
			he calls an aura of insecurity and rage and inadequacy about myself and not insult anyone at all or lie for
			a whole month, then I can walk. </b></font> I ain't turning soft or nothing, but I got to get back on the
	streets. The thing about Perkins is he's not bad for a screw, but I've done a lot of bird, because I'm very
	dangerous, and I once beat up a blind man in Dungeness High Street in Kent (still, he deserved it, 'cause he was
	staring at my bird's chest and anyway, I imagine he ain't reading this.). The other thing about Perkins is he is an
	absolute wanker and a little bit of a perv. Keeps asking me if I have feelings for my mum! <font class="orange12">
		<b>I love my mum, but not like that.</b></font> The other thing about Perkins is his wife looks like a moose
	having a bad hair day.<br>
	<br>
	<font class="purple18">Anyways, I've done a lot of work on the memory banks this month.</font><br>Thinking about
	things. After all nostalgia's not what is was (I said this first) apart from where I'm concerned. But the 80's were
	definitely better than today. Look at the facts - <b>I was on the top of my game. Now, I'm in a half way house.</b>
	People knew how to dress - now they think wearing green smocks and straight jackets is the way to go, at least round
	my way. <font class="green12">Back then, you knew what people was all about - money.</font> Now, all people talk
	about is feelings and rubbish like that. All gets very confusing, whichever way you look at it.<br>
	<br>
	<font class="orange18">When I left Kent for <a href="http://www.vicecity.com/" target="_blank" class="orange18">Vice
			City</a>, I was a nobody.</font><br>A snotty little kid with a cheeky grin and a nasty line in tracksuits.
	By the time I left, I'd made it real big. I was a player. How did this happen? It was inevitable. You take an acne
	ridden compulsive liar from the Medway towns and drop him anywhere in America and he will come up smelling of roses.
	I knew everyone. I discovered most of the <a href="music.html" target="_self">bands</a> popular in the 1980's, but
	never got the credit. You see, I wasn't too interested in contracts. I was all about the music. It was like a
	passion for me. That and birds and drugs. They was my passions. Very original I was, I invented all of that
	crap.<br>
	<br>
	<img src="graphics/degenatronHome.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5">What's more, is I just got sent <a
		href="https://the-rg-archive.github.io/degenatron.com/" target="_blank">THIS LINK</a> by some moron because I
	mentioned the Degenatron thing last month. <font class="blue12">The bloke who wrote me is a right mug, clearly, and
		looks like he hasn't had so much as a hand shandy since 1987,</font> so we've got that it common, I guess. But,
	please, bear in mind, now I spend all my time on computers, 'cause there ain't nothing else to do apart from try to
	watch the nurses getting changed, but in the 80's, I was a bit more interested with giving it very large portions.

	<br>
	Quite a poetical introduction, and that's because I'm in quite a poetical mood. Well, I have to be honest, first up,
	I've got to apologise to Mrs. Perkins. She's not a dog at all. She's really quite attractive if you like the larger
	lady, and I also have to admit I was joking when I said that I had had her. I never had her. In fact, right, I think
	her husband, the esteemed and caring Dr. Perkins is right when he says his wife has never been unfaithful to him
	during a successful 30 year marriage and they have raised five lovely children and that is exactly the kind of thing
	you can get too, if you play by the rules.<br>
	<br>
	<font class="orange12"><b>Only, let's be honest, playing by the rules was never Paulo's style.</b></font> I was a
	player. Not a referee. Seriously, I'm sorry for any offence I caused and everything, but do me a favour? I mean,
	Paul, from Kent, aka Kent Paul. <b>I was the main man back then and when I get back on my feet, I'll be the main man
		again,</b> and not writing apologies to shrinks or their fat wives, who I definitely could have had. But, well,
	back to me.<br>
	<br>
	Not the best month for Paulo. Not too good at all, in fact. Got a bit of a knock back on this night club I was going
	to run. The 80's are back. You don't need me to tell you that, and I was going to be running this very fashionable
	little exclusive discotheque down in the Isle of Thanet, but the funding fell through. Stupid pillock. So, I've
	decided to spend an extra month in the after care. Face up to a few things. That demon grandiosity, Perkins calls
	it. I call it ambition, mate. The thing that made this country great. Gave us an empire. <font class="purple12">
		After all, we invented football, but we never win the bloody world cup, do we?</font><br>
	<br>
	So, anyway, back to memories. I had a right funny hair cut back then. Looked like a proper pillock. But what you
	going to do? <font class="blue12"><b>I don't make the rules, I only break them!</b></font> And it seems you people
	are loving Kent Paul's Nostalgia Zone.<br>
	<br>
	A lot of people came here last month, and not just family. (Hi mum!) I even got a letter last week.<br>
	<br>
	From a certain <a href="mailto:JeffJohnson234@hotmail.com">JeffJohnson234@hotmail.com</a><br>
	<br>
	<i>
		Dear Kent,<br>
		<br>
		I'm a big 80s fan. Loved your website. I live in Missouri. Where is Kent? We have a lot of corn here and we all
		drive cars. Do they have cars in Kent? Will you be my friend? I'm very lonely. I've got a big knife and I want
		to cut myself. I love goth music. And old televsion shows. Anyways, I was watching cable all last week, and I
		noticed you made a couple of errors. First - the family was called the Chesterfields, not the Dawkins. And then,
		you say the little kid was 35, but in fact he was 42. That's why he kept saying "but I'm 42." Because he was. He
		didn't say "I'm 35." I mean, I think he might have, but only when he was. Also, he was an investment banker not
		a bond trader as you have it on your website, which is wrong. I don't think you can really call yourself a fan
		of Five of Us. I've been to lots of conventions. And I still have a lunchbox. Please write back. <br>
		<br>
		Keep on trucking!<br>
		<br>
		Jeff.<br></i>
	<br>
	Well, thanks Jeff. You prat. First up, I'm called Paul. I'm from Kent, near London. Second's, I don't care. <a
		href="tvShows.html" target="_self">That show</a> was crap. Third's, no, you can't be my friend. Fourth's I hope
	you are in prison or something. Am I making myself clear? <br>
	<br>
	As you can see, I'm the talk of the internet! Wonder how many people went to see <a
		href="https://the-rg-archive.github.io/darrenwebb.com/" target="_blank">Darren's ponce site</a>? Wonder how many
	debates he sparked up? Not many. For your information, Darren's doses have been upped and he's back in the padded
	cell. Revenge, I call it. Don't mess with the beast, as my old boy used to say. <br>
	<br>
	So, anyway, I was remembering, right, how things was and stuff. And they were really pretty good. Had a lot of fun.
	I was in <a href="http://www.vicecity.com/" target="_blank">Vice City</a> as a major player in the record business,
	working with all of the top acts as an uncredited executive producer and creative influence, <b>but I fell in with
		the wrong crowd. Myself.</b> Know what I mean? <br>
	<br>
	In <a href="http://www.vicecity.com/" target="_blank">Vice City</a>, we had the lot, nightclubs, muggers, psychos,
	lunatics, self help gurus, porno stars.<br>
	<br>
	But maybe you know about that already. It was a fabulous place. Real smart and all that fancy architecture. But
	there was a nasty side. Some very dodgy characters. Villains I call them, although Perkins calls them sociopaths or
	people with low self-esteem and a lot of weaponry. Make your own mind up. Times were easier back then, because we
	all knew what was going on. Make a load of money. Use it to borrow a load more money. Buy a lot of really expensive
	stuff on the never never, then go bankrupt. A simple life, much better than this crap, Perkins.

	<font class="orange12"><b>More from the 80s as they really were</b></font><br>
	<font class="orange12"><b>(officially rated the most popular site on the internet in East Kent and Dungeness)</b>
	</font><br>
	<br>
	<font class="purple18">Ha ha—stick that in your pipe and smoke it.</font><br>They said I had a five minute attention
	span, but they were wrong. Kent Paul is back with more of my exciting and amusing remin, remini, well, my memories
	of the 1980s. The decade of decadence. A time when entertainment wasn't watching a <a href="tvShows.html">TV
		show</a> or going to the <a href="movies.html">movies</a>*, but was manipulating a plastic cube until all of the
	colours were in the same place. <br>
	<br>
	Well, to those who enjoyed <a href="home.html#july1">last month's website</a>**, I can assure you it's only going to
	get a lot better. For starters, I'm getting the hang of this HTML lark, and for seconds, <b>now that the
		tranquilizers have worn off</b>, my memory is flooding back. Some of them ain't too happy, and all. But most of
	them are funny as anything. Especially for me.<br>
	<br>
	<font class="orange18">But it's not just about me, it's also about the 1980s.</font><br>
	And that's what this site is all about. The 1980s and me. When I was in <a href="http://www.vicecity.com/"
		target="_blank">Vice City</a> I showed the yanks a thing or two about being a geezer. <font class="blue12"><b>A
			proper geezer from Kent, not some idiot from Essex.</b></font> Down at the Malibu every night, I would hold
	court like a man with a court in his hand and I also knew lots of powerful people. Including some really nasty ones,
	because I'd be lying if I pretended I kept my nose entirely clean. That was never my style, I was too smart for
	that, even though it did all end up with me making a website for 13 people to enjoy while I do the loast of my time
	in my aftercare programme, which is great and everything and to be honest, all them times were about lies and the
	person I lied to most was myself and I really have to apologise to someone I care about a lot—me, for wasting
	everything and throwing it all away and looking for the easy way out and so on and so forth, but well, I promise
	you, I knew a few people and had a right laugh, I can promise you that.<br>
	<br>
	<font class="purple12">Anyway, <a href="http://www.vicecity.com/" target="_blank">Vice City</a> is still going
		strong, if you like beaches and inane half-wits and guys called Geraldo,</font> but it ain't what it was. Centre
	of the known universe back then and a right laugh. From the Malibu to Prawn Island and back again. From fancy
	parties to even fancier hotels, I was everywhere and you tell me I'm making it up? You tell me I'm deceiving myself?
	You tell me I never amounted to nothing? <b>I tell you to stick it, Doctor Perkins. I was a player.</b> Not some
	pillock in a white coat handing out pills to a bunch of burnouts. You're a loser, mate. A loser and your wife is a
	dog. And I've had her. <br>

	<br>
	<font class="boilerplate">
		* = Before you write in and complain, I'm speaking metaphorically. I know movies and TV were popular in the

	there's loads of other things we didn't have, too, like a sense of concern for our fellow man, or sports utility
	vehicles. But to find out more about that, you'll have to wait for my <a href="cars.html" class="blue12">car
		section</a>, which will come as soon as I figure out how to do the HTML. But seriously, if you'd told me that
	I'd learn how to use a computer. Well, in 1986 I didn't even know what a computer was. Or I did, but I thought
	computers were for squares. <img src="graphics/vic20.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="64" align="left" hspace="5"
		vspace="5">And they were, because if you were hip, you were in a club, like the Malibu. You weren't spending
	your time in an after care program, learning skills to suit you in the new economy. I mean, this is great and I'm
	really positive and everything, but, I'll be honest with you, things were better in the 80s. You knew where you
	were. <font class="blue12">It was a great time, a time when <b>'bribe'</b> and <b>'corruption'</b> and <b>'man made

	from really young people. Or dweebs! Or people who forget everything, like I tried to. Well, not forgotten and
	certainly not forgiven. That's what they told me in court and that's my message to you. We won't forget you and we
	won't forgive you, for making us all victims. Fashion victims!<br>
	<br>
	<font class="orange18">I was maybe the worst fashion victim in town,</font><br>
	and I was in a town full of them. Probably the most hip, happening and certainly hot place in the whole of the
	1980s. <a href="http://www.vicecity.com/" target="_blank">Vice City.</a> Oh, I know <a
		href="http://www.vicecity.com/" target="_blank">Vice City</a> is still around today and having something a
	revival as corruption and depravity come back into fashion, but in the 80s it was something else. <b>The place was
		on fire.</b> Sometimes literally. When I first arrived there it was a thriving metropolis, and despite my best
	efforts, it still stands. I don't think I could ever claim to have been king of the city, (my therapist complains a
	lot about my grandiosity, whatever that means) but certainly I was the crown prince and for a while, I was also the
	court jester.<br>
