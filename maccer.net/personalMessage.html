You know what, I was a bloody fool. The facts are, I ran around like a little monkey for a lot of years. And what was I running from? Who bloody knows? But while it was a good laugh and that, right, its over. Them days is for wankers. These days, I'm all about Krant, right, as I've discovered a new and bettter way to look after meself. It's no longer a vicious and nasty trail of pregnant women, used up drugs and destroyed hotel rooms in my wake. Now, I am a man of the tract. oh, I know, I know, how could the chemical doctor sort his selkf out, kidda? Well, I couldn't. On me own, I was lost, proper lost, but thanks to Cris Formage and the fine folks at <a href="https://the-rg-archive.github.io/epsilonprogram.com-2004/" target="_blank">The Epsilon Programme</a>, I've found a btter way to live. No more cocaine, no more heroin, no more ceaselss, boundless self pleasure. henceforth, ladies and mentle pateints, I am following the words of the tract! The world is 157 years old. Sperm is a lie! Proper truth, man, when you think about it, like. And, what's more, The Epsilon Tract only tithes at 8.75% so I've found salvation for a low, low price. You know what? Give it a try. You might like it. My music is better than ever, and finally, my <a href="personalQuotes.html">lyrics</a> are infused with spirituality.
