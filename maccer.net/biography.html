Recording artist, hedonist, pleasure seeker in so many ways, MACCER has personified the Madchester scene for years. <br>
<br>
Born in Salford in 1965, MACCER made partying into a lifestyle, and hard partying into a religion. He invented the musical style that became known as EXTREMELY BAGGY. There isn't a drug he hasn't tried, a form of self abuse he has not practiced and a musical taboo he has not broken. With The Gurning Chimps he took the sound of Manchester to the world. The world did not know what had hit it. For years, Maccer and the rest of The Chimps, under the careful stewardship of notorious manager Pabsy (whatever happened to him?) toured the world, leaving a trail of destruction, stains and mayhem whereever they went.<br>
<br>
Now, after a long career hiatus, caused by numerous legal disputes, MACCER is back, and this time, he's clean!
