The one.  The only.  The legend.  The man who taught the world how to gang bang.  Maybe he was always holed up in a mansion somewhere in Vinewood, but he spoke about the streets like it was real, playa.  He certainly drank like he was in a lot of pain.  I mean, the entire rap world at the time knew that he was the bomb.  He could claim to have killed people better than any fool alive, he could talk about places he didn't live in better than anyone, he could pretend to be someone he wasn't better than anyone, period.  The man was a genius.  But like all genii, or whatever the plural of genius is, he was troubled.  He suffered personal tragedy when his manager was killed (just proving that the streets will get you in the end, for real) and he kept losing his rhyme book and his mind to drinks and drugs. 
  <p>But the music kept coming. This guy kept rhyming and the record sales from the late 80s to the mid 90s were incredible. He sold lots of them. I don't know how many, but I'm sure it was a lot.</p></td>

A real underground hero.  He only came out with one record and was never heard from again, but LOC was the real deal. He had strong ties with Grove Street families, and really played up his gang affiliations.  Loc lived it as he saw it - he spent a lot of time in jail, he made revenge killings, he did it all.  He WAS the streets.  What he lacked in technical ability he more than made up for in raw energy and enthusiasm, but opinion was divided on how good his mic skills were.  Some claim LOC was the worst rapper ever to pick up a mic, while others, in particular his own PR department, claimed it was "a whole new style of hip hop, fusing dancehall reggae, nursery rhymes and straight gangsta into a str8 bundle of energy and hatred" - they don't make 'em like that any more. He disappeared without a trace after one poorly received record.<br>

				Often derided as "The Cheerleader of Hip-Hop", the unapologetically blond and bubbly femme fatale' Rochell'le charmed the charts with her hits, "Dreamin'", "My Dream Came True," and "Dream Rap." It wasn't all tea parties and teddy bears, though, when her mettle was tested by The Real Rochelle's parody "Rochell'le, Rochell'le". Rochell'le's swift response, purportedly ghost-written by her 


 purportedly

 then-boyfriend Madd Dogg, laid her challenger to rest. Titled "Rochell'le's Revenge", Rochell'le (not The Real Rochelle, but the original Rochell'le) lyrically destroyed her similarly-named rival with clear logic: simply, that there could only be one Rochell'le, due to the uniqueness of her name and the unusual apostrophe before the final two letters.
				<p>Rochell'le's later albums exploited her, ahem, assets, with steady encouragement from her then manager/producer Jimmy Silverman. "Leg$" (1991) and "Dangerous Curves" (1994) followed with declining sales as public interest waned. Where's she at now?? The game needs you - We miss you, girl!!</p></td>

				A West Coast pioneer in hardcore tales, unflinching views of street life, and the most playful misogyny, Gaffle One laid the foundation of Gangsta Realism in hip-hop.  Before the fade and a half moon was the notorious Gaffle One steady perm, a pompadour he used to lure impressionable girls into his lucrative pimp trade.  The Gaff' poured his prostitution profits directly into the production of his debut classic, "I Ain't Tha ONE", which he sold by the thousands out of the trunk of his 1979 Remington (The GaffleMobile).
				<p>Recognizing a clear multi-level marketing opportunity, the international conglomerate ScamWay partnered with Gaffle One in his grass roots sales endeavors. This encouraged "Tha Gaffla" to go legit and build the first street pyramid business, selling his tapes through an army of commissioned distributors.</p>
				<p>Today, Gaffle One is better known by his birthname, Gern Blanston, the top North American representative for ScamWay. Gern leads the continent in sales of toothpaste, stain remover products, and commemorative coins. </p></td>

					Blastin Fools, 1993</font><br>

If Madd Dogg was mad on "Still Madd," then "Forty Dogg" could have been titled, "Even Madder Than on Still Madd." Fueled by the turmoil in his personal life (failed relationship with Rochell'le, defecting Doggy Boyz, and mounting debt), "Forty Dogg" forged new ground for Madd Dogg, as he explored a range of topics, from the pleasures of drunkenness ("Funkin' Forties") to the mind-opening benefits of weed ("Madd N A Haze"). The rest of the West quickly followed suit.<br>
<br>
This was his last great album, followed by the less-than-stellar "N.L.A.D.B. (Never Leave a Dog Behind)" in 1994. "Forty Dogg" was digitally remastered in 2003, to the delight of many fans.<br>

- "Madd Funk"<br>

The most interesting thing about this album is the obvious departure from the "good girl" image on her debut. A more confident and revealing Rochell'le appears, not afraid to flaunt her fair-skinned sexuality to the urban market. The pop world was stunned by this reverse cross-over move, and while the street flocked to this release, her suburban fanbase vanished.<br>
